# FIRST Robotics Team 2386 - Trojans: 2024 Offseason Swerve Drive

2386 Swerve Drive Code. Offseason project (March 2024 - January 2025).

This code is written solely for our 2024 FRC robot. 
Attempting to run the code on any other robot will require modifications.

## Project Goals

- Building and running autonomous paths in realtime
- Selecting and running autos based on an order of game pieces, not pre-built autos selected via drop-down
- Refining note detection in auto, allowing the robot to smoothly adjust position to pick up notes
- Refining tag detection in auto, allowing for smooth adjustment/scoring using apriltags
- Trajectory prediction, allowing the robot to predict where a note will land once shot
- Robot-aided shooting, allowing the robot to adjust position and score while moving
- Managing all robot functions on one controller

## Getting Started
